qsuperApolynomials = quantum super-A-polynomials : related code(s).

Here is a github repository of notes (in LaTeX, .TeX), Sage Math and (Python) sympy scripts of (background) topics related to quantum super-A-polynomials, and for quantum super-A-polynomials. 

I start to review Gauge Theory, which involves:
Lie Groups and Lie Algebras
SL(2,C) and SU(2), SO(3)
